This is the project for the course of Statistical Method for High Dimensional Data by Prof. Bruno Scarpa. 

We focus on the NBA dataset (shooting motion and path detail dataset, 2k dataset, player dataset and team dataset) collected from various source on the internet and perform three tasks: salary analysis, position classification and three point shooting accuracy.
There are three different files: data_generation, dataset and code which contains the codes to merge and clean the dataset, the raw dataset and the modified ones, codes to three different tasks.
